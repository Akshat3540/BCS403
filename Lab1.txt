Step 1: Creating a Table (Keep Autocommit turned Off)

CREATE TABLE Employee (
EMPNO NUMBER,
ENAME VARCHAR2(50),
JOB VARCHAR2(50),
MANAGER_NO NUMBER,
SAL NUMBER,
COMMISSION NUMBER
);
[If Table already exists, use 
DROP TABLE <table_name>
to delete table]

Output: Table Created.

Step 2: Inserting 3 records into the table (Execute each INSERT query one-by-one)
INSERT INTO Employee (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MANAGER_NO, SAL,COMMISSION)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Manager', NULL, 5000, 1000);

Output: 1 row(s) inserted.

INSERT INTO Employee (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MANAGER_NO, SAL, COMMISSION)
VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 'Clerk', 1, 3000, NULL);

Output: 1 row(s) inserted.

INSERT INTO Employee (EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, MANAGER_NO, SAL, COMMISSION)
VALUES (3, 'Alice Johnson', 'Analyst', 1, 4000, 500);

Output: 1 row(s) inserted.

Step 3: (ROLLBACK is used to undo the last change made, autocommit should be turned off before query execution)
ROLLBACK;
SELECT * FROM Employee;

Output: No Data Found

Step 4: Adding Primary Constraint and Not Null constraint (Basically adding rules to the database, execute each ALTER statement one-by-one)

ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Employee PRIMARY KEY (EMPNO);
[If "ORA-02264: name already used by an existing constraint" error, change constraint name to something else, example:
ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Employee1 PRIMARY KEY (EMPNO);]

Output: Table Altered

ALTER TABLE Employee MODIFY (ENAME NOT NULL, JOB NOT NULL, SAL NOT NULL);

Output: Output: Table Altered
