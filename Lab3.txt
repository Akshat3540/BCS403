Step 1:

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    E_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    E_name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INTEGER,
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Step 2:

INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'Braham Kumar', 30, 50000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Shubham Kumar', 25, 60000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Anjali Kumari', 35, 55000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (4, 'Aman Kumar', 28, 62000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (5, 'Shoaib Akhtar', 40, 70000);

Step 3:

SELECT COUNT(E_NAME) AS "NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES" 
FROM EMPLOYEE;

Step 4:

SELECT MAX(AGE) AS "MAXIMUM AGE" 
FROM EMPLOYEE;

Step 5:

SELECT MIN(AGE) AS "MINIMUM AGE"
FROM EMPLOYEE;

Step 6:

SELECT E_NAME, SALARY 
FROM EMPLOYEE 
ORDER BY SALARY ASC;

Step 7:

SELECT Age, SUM(SALARY) AS "TOTAL SALARY"
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY AGE;
